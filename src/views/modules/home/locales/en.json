  "introduction": "People have grown tired of the barbaric life of eating raw flesh and drinking blood, which is why they summoned the courage to borrow fire from the heavens to dispel the dark ages; and when people finally learned to ignite the woodpile with their own strength, the priests holding the fire quietly exited the historical stage.
